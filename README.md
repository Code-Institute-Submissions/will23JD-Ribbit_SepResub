        a basic frog is displayed to fill the space.

## Testing

### Web browers
* When testing in different browers I wanted to make sure all feature and style look and functioned the same. This is important so that the user can have the same expeerience on any different brower. I tested that the page opens and works in browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox,and Bing. To test the different browsers I used my computer to test Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and bing

### Responsiveness
* By using bootstrap I was able to make sure, the content was view able on all screen sizes with out stretching or overflow.

3. Create requirments.txt: pip3 freeze --local > requirments.txt
4. Create a new django project: django-admin startproject pojectname .
5. Create a new django app: python3 manage.py startapp appname
6. Add your new app the the projects installed apps: projectname > settings.py > scroll to INSTALLED_APPS > add 'appname', to the list
7. save the file
8. Now back to the terminal to migrate the changes: python3 manage.py migrate
9. Run your project: python3 manage.py runsever
10. And you're up and running just like that!

7. Then: os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Your copied DATABASE_URL"
8. After that create your secret key: os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Your random secret key"
9. Save the file and then copy the secret key
10. Back at your heroku app Config Vars add the key: SECRET_KEY and the value: Your copied secret key
11. Back in your projects settings.py file under the first import
12. import os, import dj_database_url
13. The add the if statement: if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
                                    import env
14. Now just under that replace the insercure key and replace it with = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
### postgreSQL
