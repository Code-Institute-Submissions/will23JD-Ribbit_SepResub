    * ### Imagery
        * As images are able to be uploaded, by registered users, 
        there is no theme, or stlye however if a user doesn't choose an images\
        a basic frog is displayed to fill the space.

    * ### Colour Scheme

        of a frog(Hence the name Ribbit)

    * ### Typography 
        * For my body and p elements, I used: [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)
        with a weight of 500. As this is a clean and easie to read font

        * For the head emelents, I used: [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) with a 
        weight of 400 as this again was a clean font.
