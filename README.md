* ## Design 

    * ### Imagery
        * As images are able to be uploaded, by registered users, 
        there is no theme, or stlye.  

    * ### Colour Scheme
        * I used a mix of green throughout the page to stick with the theme
        of a frog(Hence the name Ribbit)

        ![Color scheme](documentation/screenshots/colorPallet.png)

    * ### Typography 
        * For my body and p elements, I used: [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)
        with a weight of 500. As this is a clean and easie to read font

        * For the head emelents, I used: [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) with a 
        weight of 400 as this again was a clean font.

## Testing

### Web browers
* When testing in different browers I wanted to make sure all feature and style look and functioned the same. This is important so that the user can have the same expeerience on any different brower. I tested that the page opens and works in browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox,and Bing. To test the different browsers I used my computer to test Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and bing
